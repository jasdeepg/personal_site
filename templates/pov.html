<h3>Description</h3>
We were commissioned to create 'something epic' for the MISC magazine launch party in San Francisco. The theme was lights, so we chose to create a spinning globe of LEDs.
<br>
<br>
Persistance of Vision is a concept that's common in many consumer electronics: something is moving so quickly that it appears to be continuous, or persistant. We wanted to create something that took that concept to another level, so we settled on a 12" spinning LED globe made up of a single dimension of lights when spun created the illusion of an entire field of LEDs. Moreover, the LEDs were all tied to I/O pins to create images on the fly.
<br>
<br>
The platform was fabricated from steel, wood, and 3D printed pieces; rotation was powered by a 12V motor tied to a power supply; and, the LED lights and rotation were controlled by an Arduino ATMega and discrete components. Stability was insured by giant clamps.
<br>
<br>
A version of the sketches for the Arduino-based interrupt timer and visualizations using Processing are on Github <a href="https://github.com/jasdeepg/sphere_timer" target='_blank'>here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jasdeepg/sphere_viz" target='_blank'>here</a>
