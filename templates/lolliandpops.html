<h3>Description</h3>
Lolli and Pops is a venture-backed confectionary company that's redefining the retail confectionary experience. 
<br>
<br>
I joined Lolli and Pops in early 2013 to lead special projects in the digital space. Since 2013, LP's digital presence has grown 500% primarily on the growth of its brick and mortar expansion. The chain of retail stores has increased from 2 units to 11 units in just under 2 years.
<br>
<br>
In addition to digital products, in 2014/2015 I built out:
<br>
	* Partnerships with core technology partners to capture key brick and mortar customer metrics (capture, counting, conversion, retention, dwell time)
	* Core merchandising technology and processes for quicker and more accurate planning and buying, enabling weekly replenishment and >2% fleet-wide retail $ comp in FY2015
	* The company's first forward-looking merchandise forecasting model (facilitating >$1M in replenishment and planned buys)
	* Core reporting for company-wide self-service business intellgence and division accountability
	* Merchandising for Lolli and Pop's premium chocolate business, driving $250K in fleet-wide sales
