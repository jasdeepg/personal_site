Between the trails within the park boundary itself, the  surrounding state forest land and the adjacent Big South Fork Recreation Area,  there are miles of trail to explore, connect and experience. Fortunately, the  State Park has a campground, cabins and inn-style rooms available so you can  establish base camp and check it all out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eStraight out of the campground or picnic area, a network of  trails can be linked together to build a loop around and through some of the  most interesting sandstone features of the area. From behind the playground,  take the Natural Bridge Trail over this disconcertingly thin arch. From the  arch, connect to the Hazard Cave Trail to pass under this giant rock overhang.  Take note of the peculiar “Cumberland Sandwort” growing on the sandy floor of  the cave and continue on, either taking the Lake View Trail for some great  overviews along the bluff of Thompson Creek or take a longer loop along the  Ridge Trail. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eJust past the main park entrance on the right is an  inconspicuous trailhead for the Hidden Passage Trail. At approximately 8 miles  in length, not including the mile detour to Double Falls, and with a mild  elevation profile, the loop is certainly not one to miss out on. Taking the  loop counterclockwise, you will scramble through “the passage”, stop by the  small, but pretty “Crystal Falls”, cross several grand overlooks of Thompson  Creek canyon, skirt past dangerously abrupt cliff faces and wander through the  secluded “Group Camp”. The side trail to Double Falls, a two tiered waterfall  surrounded by sandstone rock outcrops, is worth the extra little climb back up.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eOn the way back south on Hwy 154, a large grass field  welcomes you to the Pogue Creek Canyon State Natural Area. In 2015, Pogue Creek  SNA and Pickett SP became certified dark sky viewing locations by the  International Dark-Sky Association. The lack of light pollution in this corner  of Tennessee makes that grass field the perfect stargazing spot! In addition, a  short 1.5 mile hike out of the parking area leads to a stunning overlook of  Pogue Creek Canyon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is Going to Love It\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eThe views across these tree blanketed canyons are  spectacular. The erosion-resistant sandstone features are great to explore. The  Cumberland Plateau is the canyon country of the East and the area in and around  Pickett State Park is one of the best places to see it all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eHikers  of all abilities will enjoy the trails of Pickett State Park. Most trails form  loops and offer choices regarding length. Also, the low elevation profiles make  these trails of the fairly less strenuous kind. Navigating the boulders around  the rock houses requires some finesse, however, so don’t overestimate your  pace. There will be plenty of photo opportunities to slow you down as well.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDirections, Parking, \u0026 Regulations\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003e-Everything is located off HWY 154, north of Jamestown, TN.

Take note of the peculiar “Cumberland Sandwort” growing on the sandy floor of  the cave and continue on, either taking the Lake View Trail for some great  overviews along the bluff of Thompson Creek or take a longer loop along the  Ridge Trail. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eJust past the main park entrance on the right is an  inconspicuous trailhead for the Hidden Passage Trail. At approximately 8 miles  in length, not including the mile detour to Double Falls, and with a mild  elevation profile, the loop is certainly not one to miss out on. Taking the  loop counterclockwise, you will scramble through “the passage”, stop by the  small, but pretty “Crystal Falls”, cross several grand overlooks of Thompson  Creek canyon, skirt past dangerously abrupt cliff faces and wander through the  secluded “Group Camp”. The side trail to Double Falls, a two tiered waterfall  surrounded by sandstone rock outcrops, is worth the extra little climb back up.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eOn the way back south on Hwy 154, a large grass field  welcomes you to the Pogue Creek Canyon State Natural Area. In 2015, Pogue Creek  SNA and Pickett SP became certified dark sky viewing locations by the  International Dark-Sky Association. The lack of light pollution in this corner  of Tennessee makes that grass field the perfect stargazing spot! In addition, a  short 1.5 mile hike out of the parking area leads to a stunning overlook of  Pogue Creek Canyon. \u003c/p\u003e"},"who_is_going_to_love_it":{"title":"Who is Going to Love It","body":"\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eThe views across these tree blanketed canyons are  spectacular. The erosion-resistant sandstone features are great to explore. The  Cumberland Plateau is the canyon country of the East and the area in and around  Pickett State Park is one of the best places to see it all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eHikers  of all abilities will enjoy the trails of Pickett State Park. Most trails form  loops and offer choices regarding length. Also, the low elevation profiles make  these trails of the fairly less strenuous kind. Navigating the boulders around  the rock houses requires some finesse, however, so don’t overestimate your  pace. There will be plenty of photo opportunities to slow you down as well.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},"directions_parking_regulations":{"title":"Directions, Parking, \u0026 Regulations","body":"\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003e-Everything is located off HWY 154, north of Jamestown, TN.

These resorts draw huge crowds from near and far during the holidays, so lift lines can skyrocket and you’ll probably end up parking a mile away. (Ever walked a mile on asphalt in alpine boots?

So hop directly in your car and mosey down to the valley (beating the après traffic) for beers and warm platters of carbohydrates at the Porcupine, Lone Star Taqueria, or Bombay House, all of which are within minutes of the Cottonwood Canyons.

They have\n      significant barriers to increasing engagement – feeling tight on time, being far from outdoor places,\n      preferring indoor comforts, and having little exposure to more traditional outdoor activities. Many grew\n      up in team sports and are very active and competitive.

Rather than participating in a large range of activities, they focus on improving\n      their performance in a select few. They do feel they need good gear, but are open to relying on\n      rentals.

Do you want to ride down the gorge and back up the other side on Rim Rock, then finish with Clemmer, or do you want to drop off the eastern brow of the mountain on the Clear Creek Trail? If the former, take a right and get to it. Rim Rock heads straight back to the Benton Falls Trail, with a picturesque creek crossing at the bottom.

It’s wonderful, but it’s for advanced riders only. Proceed with caution!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom this clearing, there are three ways to go: far left is the upper part of the Naked Widow loop, middle is the lower part of Naked Widow, and the far right-hand option is the conclusion of the Hancock Loop. All three are fun, and the middle option is the rockiest and most technical. Both sides of Naked Widow intersect with Benton Falls; Hancock returns to a forest road, and you’ll need to go left and ride downhill a bit longer before reaching the Benton Falls Trail. At the end of the trail, you’ll intersect highway 30. Take a right, follow the pavement past the Parksville Lake Campground, and you’ll find yourself right back at the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is Going to Love It\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eChilhowee is a bit of a time capsule. It harkens back to a time when trails were hand-built and mountain bikes had 26” wheels. Beginners with the right attitude will have fun here, but expect soaring heart rates and the occasional short hike-a-bike. There is a sort of “Western North Carolina” feel to these trails, from the thick bands of rhododendron and mountain laurel to the Pisgah-esque feel here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eWho will like it? Anyone who likes riding on raw, old-school trail without buffed grade reversals and bermed turns. A mile away from either trailhead, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only person in the forest, an experience which is difficult to replicate at any of the trail systems in town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eEndurance riders will find no shortage of gravel forest roads to link with the trail system here, most notably the long slog from the campground north to Oswald Dome where encountering traffic is relatively rare.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDirections, Parking, \u0026 Regulations\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom Chattanooga, take I-75 north to exit 20 and take a right onto highway 64. Stay on 64, following signs for the Ocoee River. After passing Rock/Creek on your right and entering the forest, you’ll skirt the edge of Parksville Lake / Lake Ocoee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eDo NOT follow signs for the “Chilhowee Recreation Area” unless you intend to drive 7 miles up to the top of the mountain and start from the campground. Instead, to reach the Clemmer Trailhead (as described above), drive a little further. You’ll take a left onto highway 30 toward the Parksville Lake Campground, and the gravel trailhead parking lot will appear immediately on your left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003ePlease be respectful of hikers, the vast majority of whom will be accessing Benton Falls from the campground atop the mountain or will be parking at Clemmer in order to hike the Scenic Spur Trail to hike to Rainbow Falls (Rattlesnake Falls). Also, please DO NOT MODIFY any trail features. One of the best rock gardens at Chilhowee was recently chopped and dismantled by a visiting mountain biker, gone forever.

A left brings you back to Clemmer; add in the Rim Rock Spur loop (on your left) if you want one more quick hit of narrow singletrack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eIf you prefer the Clear Creek route: Clear Creek involves a steep climb, a few fun rock gardens, some seriously gnarly and technical terrain that will have most riders walking a short stretch or two, then some fast-and-loose descending with a couple of wide creek crossings at the bottom. It’s wonderful, but it’s for advanced riders only. Proceed with caution!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom this clearing, there are three ways to go: far left is the upper part of the Naked Widow loop, middle is the lower part of Naked Widow, and the far right-hand option is the conclusion of the Hancock Loop. All three are fun, and the middle option is the rockiest and most technical. Both sides of Naked Widow intersect with Benton Falls; Hancock returns to a forest road, and you’ll need to go left and ride downhill a bit longer before reaching the Benton Falls Trail. At the end of the trail, you’ll intersect highway 30. Take a right, follow the pavement past the Parksville Lake Campground, and you’ll find yourself right back at the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e"},"who_is_going_to_love_it":{"title":"Who is Going to Love It","body":"\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eChilhowee is a bit of a time capsule. It harkens back to a time when trails were hand-built and mountain bikes had 26” wheels. Beginners with the right attitude will have fun here, but expect soaring heart rates and the occasional short hike-a-bike. There is a sort of “Western North Carolina” feel to these trails, from the thick bands of rhododendron and mountain laurel to the Pisgah-esque feel here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eWho will like it? Anyone who likes riding on raw, old-school trail without buffed grade reversals and bermed turns. A mile away from either trailhead, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only person in the forest, an experience which is difficult to replicate at any of the trail systems in town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eEndurance riders will find no shortage of gravel forest roads to link with the trail system here, most notably the long slog from the campground north to Oswald Dome where encountering traffic is relatively rare.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e"},"directions_parking_regulations":{"title":"Directions, Parking, \u0026 Regulations","body":"\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom Chattanooga, take I-75 north to exit 20 and take a right onto highway 64.
